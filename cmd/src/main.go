	//make a byte slice as aboove wich will grow and shrinc, but this will make an empty byte slice and make it n big
	// Comment out D lines, unncomment A lines to see

	//now we can get the responce body and use the read reciver on that passing in the byte slice that we created.

	//its importent to undertand that this is useing the writer interface rather than the read.
	//what is happaning is that io.Copy takes an interface that implements write (os.Stdout) and an interface that implaments
	//read (resp.Body) where Body implaments read and then it automates the reso of the process in the io class. returning te output,
	//we can use this nowlage to creat out own custm interfaces to implament code.

//so if we take the badWriter struct from above and we implament a func called Write  withe a rivever of type badWriter we can then use
//it with anything that requires Write. it satisfies all of the nessisery conditions of io.Copy cowever as there is nothing in the function
//it will perform badly. this is the danger of interfaes. GIGO it will perform and compile but iut that does not mean it will work.

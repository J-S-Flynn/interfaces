	//make takes a type , in this case a byte and initalises it with 99999 elements inside it, so we could
	//make a byte slice as aboove wich will grow and shrinc, but this will make an empty byte slice and make it n big
	// bs := make([]byte, 99999)

	//now we can get the responce body and use the read reciver on that passing in the byte slice that we created.
	//the read function will then push the responce into the byte slice and we can then print out that bs by rappint it in a string
	//conversion.
	// resp.Body.Read(bs)
	// fmt.Println(string(bs))

	//however go has a lot of helper methods so we could simply write
	io.Copy(os.Stdout, resp.Body)

	//its importent to undertand that this is useing the writer interface rather than the read.
